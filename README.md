# 🚖 Maximizing Taxi Company Revenue in NYC

📊 **Dataset**: [NYC Yellow Taxi Trip Data (Jan 2020)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravpathak1789/yellow-tripdata-2020-01)  

## 🧐 Project Purpose  
Analyze NYC Yellow Cab trip data to **uncover revenue-boosting strategies**:  
**How can ride patterns, payment methods, and passenger counts inform optimal taxi operations?**

## 🛠️ Data Cleaning  
- Processed ~6.4M records from NYC Yellow Taxi dataset  
- Removed duplicates, handled missing values  
- Engineered features: `duration`, trip distance consistency  
- Corrected anomalies (negative fares, invalid trips)  

## 📊 Key Findings & Visuals  
- **Card payments** ≈ 59% of trips  
- Mean fare: **\$13.11 (Card)** vs. **\$11.76 (Cash)**  
- Majority trips: **1 passenger**  
- Strong correlation: **trip duration & distance ↔️ fare amount**  

## 🧪 Hypothesis Testing  
- ✅ Statistically significant fare difference (Card vs. Cash)  
- ✅ Multi-passenger trips show higher mean fare  
- ✅ Cleaned dataset → reliable results  

## 📚 Insights & Storytelling  
- Encourage **card payments** → higher average revenue  
- Design **group ride promotions** for multi-passenger trips  
- Improve **dispatch efficiency** for long-distance trips  
- Outlier removal clarified insights
